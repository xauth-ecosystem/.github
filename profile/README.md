# XAuth Ecosystem Resources

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for **XAuth Ecosystem** — a comprehensive authentication and identity management solution for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition servers, evolving since 2021.

We develop and maintain an integrated suite of open-source plugins and tools that provide robust authentication, multi-platform account binding, and OAuth2-based identity federation for server owners and players.

---

## Core Projects

### Authentication & Security
- [**XAuth**](https://github.com/xauth-ecosystem/XAuth)  
  The foundation of our ecosystem — a modern, extensible authentication plugin for PocketMine-MP that controls user authorization flow with support for two-factor authentication and advanced security features.

- [**CaptchaLogin**](https://github.com/xauth-ecosystem/CaptchaLogin)  
  Adds an extra layer of verification using CAPTCHA challenges to prevent automated attacks and enhance account security.

### Identity Federation
- [**XAuthConnect**](https://github.com/xauth-ecosystem/XAuthConnect)  
  OAuth2 server with OpenID Connect implementation that runs directly on your game server. Enables server owners to connect custom platforms and services with player accounts through industry-standard authentication protocols.

### Supporting Tools & Libraries
- [**League OAuth2 Integration**](https://github.com/xauth-ecosystem/oauth2-xauthconnect)  
  Custom OAuth2 client library built on top of [thephpleague/oauth2-client](https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-client), designed specifically for integrating with XAuthConnect's OAuth2 server.

- [**Demo Client**](https://github.com/xauth-ecosystem/xauthconnect-php-demo-client)  
  Reference implementation showcasing how to integrate with XAuthConnect using the League library.

- [**Discord Role Bot**](https://github.com/xauth-ecosystem/discord-xauth-integration)  
  JavaScript-based Discord bot for automatic role assignment based on linked Minecraft accounts.

- [**NamelessMC Module**](https://github.com/xauth-ecosystem/namelessmc-xauthconnect-module)  
  Forum integration module that adds "Sign in with XAuthConnect" functionality to NamelessMC websites.
